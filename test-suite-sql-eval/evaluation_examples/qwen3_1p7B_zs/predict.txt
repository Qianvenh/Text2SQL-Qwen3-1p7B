To determine the type of pet that is the youngest and its weight, we need to identify the pet with the **minimum** `pet_age` from the `pets` table. This is because the question refers to "the youngest animal" without specifying ownership, implying all pets are candidates.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT pettype, weight FROM pets WHERE pet_age = (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM pets); ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT pettype, weight`**: Retrieves the type of pet and its weight. - **`FROM pets`**: Specifies the table containing pet data. - **`WHERE pet_age = (SELECT MIN(pet_age) FROM pets)`**: Filters the result to only include the pet(s) with the smallest `pet_age`.  This query ensures we find the youngest

To retrieve the `petid` and `weight` of all pets whose `pet_age` is greater than 1, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT petid, weight FROM pets WHERE pet_age > 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`pets` table**: This is the relevant table for this query, as it contains the `petid`, `pet_age`, and `weight` columns. - **Filtering condition**: `pet_age > 1` ensures only pets with an age greater than 1 are included. - **Columns selected**: `petid` and `weight` are the specific fields required by the question.  This query will return the desired results without involving the `has_pet` table, as the question focuses solely on pets themselves.

To retrieve the `petid` and `weight` of every pet that is older than 1 year, we query the `pets` table directly using the `pet_age` column. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT petid, weight FROM pets WHERE pet_age > 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`pets` table**: Contains the relevant data (`petid`, `pet_age`, `weight`). - **Condition**: `pet_age > 1` filters pets older than 1 year. - **Result**: Returns the `petid` and `weight` of all such pets.

To find the **average** and **maximum age** for each **type of pet**, we can query the `pets` table directly, as it contains the necessary information: `pettype` (to group by pet type), `pet_age` (to compute averages and maxima), and other fields like `weight` (which may or may not be relevant here).   ---  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      pettype,      AVG(pet_age) AS avg_age,      MAX(pet_age) AS max_age FROM      pets GROUP BY      pettype; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - **`pettype`**: This column identifies the type of pet (e.g., "dog", "cat"). - **`AVG(pet_age)`**: Calculates the average age of all pets of the same type. - **`MAX(pet_age)`**: Finds the oldest pet of the same type. - **`GROUP BY pettype`**: Ensures results are grouped by pet type, allowing aggregation.  This query returns the required statistics for each pet type without needing to join with the `has_pet` table, as the `pets` table already contains the full dataset for pet types.

To find the **average** and **maximum age** for each **pet type**, we can query the `pets` table and group the results by `pettype`. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      pettype,      AVG(pet_age) AS average_age,      MAX(pet_age) AS maximum_age FROM      pets GROUP BY      pettype; ```  ### Explanation: - **`pettype`**: Groups the results by pet type. - **`AVG(pet_age)`**: Calculates the average age of all pets of the same type. - **`MAX(pet_age)`**: Finds the oldest pet (maximum age) of the same type. - **`GROUP BY pettype`**: Ensures the aggregation is done per pet type.  This query will return the desired statistics for each unique pet type.

To find the **average weight** for each **pet type**, you can use the `pets` table directly since the `pettype` and `weight` columns are already present. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      pettype,      AVG(weight) AS average_weight FROM      pets GROUP BY      pettype; ```  ### Explanation: - **`pettype`**: Identifies the type of pet (e.g., dog, cat). - **`weight`**: The weight of the pet. - **`AVG(weight)`**: Calculates the average weight for each pet type. - **`GROUP BY pettype`**: Groups the results by pet type to compute the average weight per category.  This query will return the average weight for each unique pet type in the `pets` table.

To calculate the average weight for each type of pet, we can query the `pets` table directly, as it contains the required data (pettype and weight). We will group the results by `pettype` and compute the average weight for each group.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      pettype,      AVG(weight) AS avg_weight FROM      pets GROUP BY      pettype; ```  ### Explanation: - **`pettype`**: This column identifies the type of pet (e.g., dog, cat). - **`weight`**: This column stores the weight of the pet. - **`AVG(weight)`**: Computes the average weight for each pet type. - **`GROUP BY pettype`**: Groups the results by pet type to ensure the average is computed per type.  This query returns the average weight for each unique pet type in the `pets` table.

To retrieve the **first name** and **age** of students who have at least one pet, we need to join the `student` table with the `has_pet` table to identify students with pets, and then join with the `pets` table to ensure the pet exists (though this is optional for filtering, as the question focuses on students with pets).  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT s.fname, s.age FROM student s JOIN has_pet hp ON s.stuid = hp.stuid WHERE hp.petid IS NOT NULL; ```  ---  ### Explanation: - **`JOIN has_pet hp ON s.stuid = hp.stuid`**: Links students to their pets via the `has_pet` table. - **`WHERE hp.petid IS NOT NULL`**: Ensures only students with at least one pet are included. - **`SELECT s.fname, s.age`**: Retrieves the first name and age from the `student` table.

To determine the total number of employees in the database, we can query the `employee` table directly using the `COUNT(*)` function, which returns the number of rows in the table. Since `employee_id` is the primary key, each row corresponds to exactly one employee.  **SQL Query:** ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee; ```  **Result:**   The result will be a single value representing the total number of employees in the `employee` table.

To count the number of employees in the `employee` table, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `employee` table, which corresponds to the total number of employees. - The alias `num_employees` is added for clarity in the result output.  This query assumes that each row in the `employee` table represents a distinct employee and that the `employee_id` is a valid primary key (which it is per the schema).

To retrieve and sort employee names by their age in ascending order, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT name FROM employee ORDER BY age ASC; ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT name`**: Retrieves only the `name` column from the `employee` table. - **`FROM employee`**: Specifies the table to query. - **`ORDER BY age ASC`**: Sorts the results in ascending order based on the `age` column. This means younger employees appear first, followed by those with higher ages.

To retrieve the names of employees sorted in ascending order based on their age, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT name FROM employee ORDER BY age ASC; ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT name`: Retrieves only the `name` column from the `employee` table. - `FROM employee`: Specifies the table to query. - `ORDER BY age ASC`: Sorts the results in ascending order based on the `age` column.  This query will return the names of all employees listed in ascending order of their ages.

To determine the number of employees from each city, we can use the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL to aggregate the counts of employees based on their `city` field. Here's the corresponding SQL query:  ```sql SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee GROUP BY city; ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees`**: This selects the `city` column and counts the number of rows (employees) per city, labeling the count as `num_employees`. - **`FROM employee`**: Specifies the table from which to retrieve data. - **`GROUP BY city`**: Groups the results by the `city` column, allowing us to compute the count of employees in each city.  This query will return a list of cities along with the total number of employees in each city.

To count the number of employees for each city, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee GROUP BY city; ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees`**: This selects the `city` column and counts the number of rows (employees) per city, labeling the count as `num_employees`. - **`FROM employee`**: Specifies the `employee` table as the source of data. - **`GROUP BY city`**: Groups the results by the `city` column, allowing aggregation (counting) of employees per city.  This query will return a list of cities along with the number of employees in each city.

To determine which cities have **more than one employee under the age of 30**, we can follow these logical steps:  1. **Filter employees** under the age of 30 using the `employee` table. 2. **Group the results** by `city`. 3. **Count the number of employees** in each city. 4. **Select only those cities** where the count exceeds 1.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query:  ```sql SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee WHERE age < 30 GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - `age < 30`: Filters employees who are under 30 years old. - `GROUP BY city`: Groups all employees by their city. - `COUNT(*)`: Counts the number of employees in each city. - `HAVING COUNT

To find the cities where there are **more than one employee under the age of 30**, we can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS num_employees FROM employee WHERE age < 30 GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ```  ### Explanation: - `employee.age < 30`: Filters employees under the age of 30. - `GROUP BY city`: Groups results by city to aggregate counts. - `COUNT(*)`: Counts the number of employees in each city. - `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`: Filters groups to only include cities with more than one employee under 30.  This query returns the **cities** and the **number of employees under 30** in each city. Only cities with a count greater than 1 will be displayed.

To find the number of shops in each location, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS num_shops FROM shop GROUP BY location; ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS num_shops`: This selects the `location` column and counts the number of rows (shops) per location, labeling the count as `num_shops`. - `FROM shop`: Specifies the table to query. - `GROUP BY location`: Groups the results by the `location` column, ensuring the count is aggregated per unique location.  This query will return a list of locations along with the total number of shops in each location.

To determine how many shops exist in each location, we can use the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL to aggregate the count of shops based on their `location` column. Here's the corresponding SQL query:  ```sql SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS num_shops FROM shop GROUP BY location; ```  ### Explanation: - **`location`**: This column from the `shop` table contains the address or region where each shop is located. - **`COUNT(*)`**: This function counts the number of rows (shops) in each group (location). - **`GROUP BY location`**: This groups the results by the value in the `location` column, allowing us to compute the count for each distinct location.  This query will return a result set with two columns: `location` and `num_shops`, showing the number of shops in each location.

To retrieve the **manager name** and **district** of the shop(s) with the **maximum number of products**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT s.manager_name, s.district FROM shop s WHERE s.number_products = (     SELECT MAX(number_products)     FROM shop ); ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT s.manager_name, s.district`: This selects the required fields (`manager_name` and `district`) from the `shop` table. - `FROM shop s`: Specifies the table to query. - `WHERE s.number_products = (SELECT MAX(...))`: Filters rows to only those with the maximum number of products. - The subquery `(SELECT MAX(number_products) FROM shop)` calculates the highest number of products in the `shop` table.  This query will return all shops (and their managers/districts) that have the most products. If there are ties, all matching shops will be included.

To retrieve the **manager name** and **district** of the shop(s) that sell the **largest number of products**, we can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT s.manager_name, s.district FROM shop s WHERE s.number_products = (     SELECT MAX(number_products)     FROM shop ); ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT s.manager_name, s.district` retrieves the required fields from the `shop` table. - The subquery `(SELECT MAX(number_products) FROM shop)` calculates the maximum number of products sold by any shop. - The outer query filters the `shop` table to include only those shops whose `number_products` match this maximum value.  This query will return all shops with the highest product count along with their respective managers and districts.

To find the **minimum** and **maximum** number of products across all stores, we can query the `shop` table directly using the `MIN()` and `MAX()` aggregate functions on the `number_products` column.  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      MIN(number_products) AS min_products,     MAX(number_products) AS max_products FROM shop; ```  ### üìå Explanation: - `MIN(number_products)` returns the smallest value in the `number_products` column of the `shop` table. - `MAX(number_products)` returns the largest value in the same column. - This query assumes there are no null values in the `number_products` column, as specified in the schema.  This will return two results: the minimum and maximum number of products across all stores.

To determine the **minimum** and **maximum** number of products across all shops, we can query the `shop` table using the `MIN()` and `MAX()` aggregate functions on the `number_products` column.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      MIN(number_products) AS min_products,     MAX(number_products) AS max_products FROM shop; ```  ### Explanation: - `MIN(number_products)` calculates the smallest value in the `number_products` column. - `MAX(number_products)` calculates the largest value in the `number_products` column. - The result includes both the minimum and maximum values for the number of products across all shops.  This query directly answers the question by leveraging the `shop` table's `number_products` field.

SELECT name, location, district   FROM shop   ORDER BY number_products DESC;

To retrieve the names, locations, and districts of all shops sorted by the number of products in descending order, the following SQL query can be used:  ```sql SELECT name, location, district FROM shop ORDER BY number_products DESC; ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT name, location, district`**: Retrieves the required columns (`name`, `location`, and `district`) from the `shop` table. - **`FROM shop`**: Specifies the table to query. - **`ORDER BY number_products DESC`**: Sorts the results in descending order based on the `number_products` column.

To find the names of stores whose number of products exceeds the **average number of products** across all stores, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT name FROM shop WHERE number_products > (     SELECT AVG(number_products)     FROM shop ); ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT name` retrieves the store names. - `WHERE number_products > (SELECT AVG(...))` filters stores where the number of products is greater than the **average** number of products across all stores. - The subquery `(SELECT AVG(number_products) FROM shop)` calculates the average number of products for all stores.  This query ensures that only stores with a **higher count** of products than the overall average are returned.

To retrieve the names of shops whose `number_products` exceed the **average** number of products across all shops, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT name FROM shop WHERE number_products > (     SELECT AVG(number_products)     FROM shop ); ```  ### Explanation: - **Subquery**: `(SELECT AVG(number_products) FROM shop)` calculates the average number of products for all shops. - **Main Query**: Selects the `name` of shops where `number_products` is greater than this average.  This query ensures you only get shops that have more products than the overall average.

To find the name of the employee who was awarded the most times in the `evaluation` table, we can follow these steps:  1. **Join** the `employee` table with the `evaluation` table on `employee_id` to get all relevant data. 2. **Group** the results by `employee_id` to count the number of awards per employee. 3. **Order** the results in descending order based on the count of awards. 4. **Limit** the result to the topmost entry (

To determine which employee received the most awards in evaluations, we need to count the number of entries in the `evaluation` table for each employee and identify the employee with the highest count. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:  ```sql SELECT e.name FROM employee e JOIN evaluation e_val ON e.employee_id = e_val.employee_id GROUP BY e.employee_id ORDER BY COUNT(e_val.employee_id) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **Joining Tables**: We join the `employee` and `evaluation` tables on `employee_id` to align employee records with their evaluation data. - **Grouping**: We group the results by `employee_id` to aggregate the number of evaluations per employee. - **Counting Evaluations**: Using `COUNT(e_val.employee_id)` counts the number of awards (entries) each employee received. - **Ordering and Limiting**: We sort the results in descending order by the count of evaluations and limit the result to the top record, ensuring we retrieve the employee with the most

To retrieve the name of the employee who received the highest one-time bonus, we can follow these logical steps:  1. **Identify the maximum bonus** from the `evaluation` table. 2. **Filter employees** whose bonus matches this maximum value. 3. **Return the names** of those employees.  Here is the corresponding SQL query:  ```sql SELECT e.name FROM employee e WHERE e.employee_id IN (     SELECT e2.employee_id     FROM evaluation e2     WHERE e2.bonus = (SELECT MAX(e3.bonus) FROM evaluation e3) ); ```  ### Explanation: - The innermost subquery `(SELECT MAX(e3.bonus) FROM evaluation e3)` finds the highest bonus value. - The middle subquery `(SELECT e2.employee_id FROM evaluation e2 WHERE e2.b

None 

None 

To retrieve the names of employees who **never received any evaluation**, we need to identify employees whose `employee_id` does **not** appear in the `evaluation` table. This ensures that only those employees who have no records in the `evaluation` table are returned.  ### ‚úÖ Correct SQL Query: ```sql SELECT name FROM employee WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM evaluation); ```  ---  ### üìå Explanation: - **`employee` table**: Contains all employees with their details. - **`evaluation` table**: Tracks evaluations by employee (`employee_id`). - **`NOT IN` condition**: Filters out employees who have at least one evaluation record. - **`SELECT name`**: Retrieves the names of employees without any evaluation records.  This query efficiently returns the desired result while ensuring correctness.

None 

To determine which shop has the most employees, we need to join the `shop` and `hiring` tables on `shop_id`, count the number of employees per shop, and then identify the shop with the highest count.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT s.name FROM shop s JOIN hiring h ON s.shop_id = h.shop_id GROUP BY s.shop_id ORDER BY COUNT(h.employee_id) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **Joining Tables**: The `hiring` table contains records of employees assigned to shops, so joining it with `shop` allows us to associate each shop with its employees. - **Grouping and Counting**: By grouping by `shop_id` and counting the number of employees (`COUNT(h.employee_id)`), we determine how many employees each shop has. - **Sorting and Limiting**: Sorting the results in descending order of employee count ensures the shop with the most employees comes first. Using `LIMIT 1` returns only the shop with the highest count.  This query will return the name of the shop with the most employees.

To find the names of shops that do not hire any employees, we need to identify shops whose `shop_id` does not appear in the `hiring` table. This can be achieved by using a **subquery** to exclude shop IDs that are present in the `hiring` table.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT name FROM shop WHERE shop_id NOT IN (SELECT shop_id FROM hiring); ```  ---  ### Explanation: - **`shop` table**: Contains all shop details, including `shop_id`. - **`hiring` table**: Links shops to employees via `shop_id`, and includes `employee_id` and `start_from` dates. - **Subquery `(SELECT shop_id FROM hiring)`**: Retrieves all `shop_id`s that are associated with hiring employees. - **`NOT IN` condition**: Filters out shops whose `shop_id` appears in the `hiring` table, leaving only those shops without any hires.  This query efficiently returns the names of shops that are **not hired by any employees**, as required.

To identify shops that run with **no employees**, we need to find shops that do **not** have any associated entries in the `hiring` table. This is because the `hiring` table links shops to employees, and a shop without any hiring records implies no employees are employed there.  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT s.name FROM shop s LEFT JOIN hiring h ON s.shop_id = h.shop_id WHERE h.shop_id IS NULL; ```  ---  ### üß† Explanation

To find the number of employees hired in each shop and display the shop name, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      s.name AS shop_name,      COUNT(h.employee_id) AS num_employees FROM      hiring h JOIN      shop s ON h.shop_id = s.shop_id GROUP BY      s.shop_id, s.name; ```  ### Explanation: - **`hiring`** table contains `shop_id` and `employee_id`, which links to the `shop` table. - **`shop`** table provides the `name` of each shop. - **`JOIN`** ensures we combine data from both tables based on `shop_id`. - **`GROUP BY`** groups results by shop ID and name, allowing aggregation. - **`COUNT(h.employee_id)`** counts the number of employees hired in each shop.  This query will return a list of shops along with the total number of employees hired at each shop.

None 

To calculate the **total bonus given in all evaluations**, we can use the `SUM` function on the `bonus` column of the `evaluation` table. This will aggregate all bonus values across all records in the table.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT SUM(bonus) AS total_bonus FROM evaluation; ```  ### Explanation: - `SUM(bonus)` computes the total of all values in the `bonus` column. - The result is returned as `total_bonus`, which represents the cumulative bonus amount across all evaluations.  This query assumes that the `bonus` column contains numerical values (e.g., decimal numbers) representing the bonus amounts for each evaluation. If there are duplicate entries for the same employee or year, the sum will include all such values.

To calculate the **total amount of bonus** given in all evaluations, we need to sum the `bonus` column from the `evaluation` table. This table contains the necessary data, as the `bonus` value is explicitly stored there.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT SUM(bonus) AS total_bonus FROM evaluation; ```  ### Explanation: - **`SUM(bonus)`**: Calculates the total of all values in the `bonus` column. - **`FROM evaluation`**: Specifies the table containing the bonus data. - **`AS total_bonus`**: Provides a descriptive alias for the result column.  This query will return a single value: the **total bonus amount across all evaluations**.

To retrieve all the information about hiring, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT * FROM hiring; ```  ### Explanation: - This query selects **all columns** (`*`) from the `hiring` table. - It retrieves **every row** (record) in the `hiring` table, which contains information about hires such as:   - `shop_id`: The ID of the shop where the employee was hired.   - `employee_id`: The ID of the employee who was hired.   - `start_from`: The date the employee started working.   - `is_full_time`: Whether the employee is full-time.  This query will return a complete dataset of all hiring records based on the provided schema.

To retrieve all information about hiring, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT * FROM hiring; ```  ### Explanation: - This query selects **all columns** from the `hiring` table. - It does not include any joins with other tables (e.g., `employee`, `shop`) unless explicitly required. - The result will return every record in the `hiring` table, which includes:   - `shop_id`: The ID of the shop associated with the hire.   - `employee_id`: The ID of the employee hired.   - `start_from`: The date when the hire began.   - `is_full_time`: Whether the employee is full-time.  If additional details (e.g., shop name, employee name) are needed, you would need to join this query with the `shop` and `employee` tables.

To determine the number of **different store locations**, we need to examine the `shop` table, which contains a `location` column. The goal is to count the **distinct** values in this column.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location) AS num_distinct_locations FROM shop; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT location)` ensures we only count unique locations. - The `shop` table is the source of all location data. - This query returns the total number of unique store locations in the database.

To count the number of **distinct store locations**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location) AS distinct_locations FROM shop; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT location)` counts how many unique values exist in the `location` column of the `shop` table. - The result is returned as `distinct_locations`, which represents the number of unique store locations.

To determine the total number of documents in the database, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_documents FROM documents; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `documents` table. - The result will return a single value: the total number of documents.  This query assumes that each row in the `documents` table represents a unique document, even if it may not be linked to a specific template (though the `template_id` is required for referencing templates).

To count the number of documents in the database, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS document_count FROM documents; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `documents` table. - The result will return a single value: the total number of documents.

SELECT document_id, document_name, document_description   FROM documents;

To retrieve the `id`, `name`, and `description` of all documents, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      document_id,      document_name,      document_description  FROM      documents; ```  ### Explanation: - **`document_id`**: The unique identifier for each document. - **`document_name`**: The name of the document. - **`document_description`**: The descriptive text associated with the document.  This query directly selects the required fields from the `documents` table without requiring joins or additional filtering.

To retrieve the **document name** and **template ID** for documents whose **description contains the letter 'w'**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      d.document_name,      d.template

None 

To retrieve the `document_id`, `template_id`, and `document_description` for a document named `"Rob

To retrieve the `document_id`, `template_id`, and `document_description` for the document titled **"Robbin CV"**, we can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      documents.document_id,      documents.template_id,      documents.document_description FROM      documents WHERE      documents.document_name = 'Robbin CV'; ```  ### Explanation: - **`documents.document_name`** is used to filter the row where the document name matches `'Robbin CV'`. - **`documents.document_id`** and **`documents.template_id`** are selected directly from the `documents` table. - **`documents.document_description`** provides the description of the document itself.  This query assumes that there is exactly one document with the name `"Robbin CV"` in the database. If multiple documents match the name, additional filtering or sorting may be required.

To determine how many **different templates** are used by all documents, we need to:  1. **Join** the `documents` table with the `templates` table using the `template_id` field, as each document is associated with exactly one template. 2. **Extract** the `template_type_code` from the joined result. 3. **Count** the number of distinct `template_type_code` values, which represents the number of unique template types used across all documents.

To count the number of **distinct templates** used in documents, we need to examine the `documents` table, which links to the `templates` table via the `template_id`. Each row in the `documents` table represents a document associated with a specific template, and we want to count how many **unique** template IDs exist across all documents.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT template_id) AS num_distinct_templates FROM documents; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT template_id)` ensures we only count unique template IDs. - The `documents` table contains all documents, and each document is tied to one template via its `template_id`. - This query returns the total number of **different templates** used in the documents.

To determine how many documents use the template with type code `'PPT'`, we need to join the `documents` table with the `templates` table on `template_id`, filter for templates with `template_type_code = 'PPT'`, and count the resulting rows.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS document_count FROM documents JOIN templates ON documents.template_id = templates.template_id WHERE templates.template_type_code = 'PPT'; ```  ### Explanation: - **`JOIN documents ON documents.template_id = templates.template_id`**: Links documents to their respective templates. - **`WHERE templates.template_type_code = 'PPT'`**: Filters for templates with the specified type code. - **`COUNT(*)`**: Returns the total number of documents matching the condition.  This query will return the number of documents using the template with type code `'PPT'`.

To count the number of documents that use the **"PPT"** template type, we need to perform the following steps:  1. **Join** the `documents` table with the `templates` table using the `template_id` foreign key. 2. **Filter** the joined results to only include documents where the `template_type_code` matches `'PPT'`. 3. **Count** the number of such documents.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM documents d JOIN templates t ON d.template_id = t.template_id WHERE t.template_type_code = 'PPT'; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - `JOIN templates t ON d.template_id = t.template_id`: Links documents to their respective templates. - `t.template_type_code = 'PPT'`: Filters for documents using the "PPT" template type. - `COUNT(*)`: Returns the total number of documents matching this condition.  This query assumes that the `"PPT"` template type exists in the `ref_template_types` table (as required by the schema). If the actual value might vary (e.g., case-insensitive), you may need to adjust the string comparison accordingly.

To retrieve all **template IDs** along with the **number of documents** associated with each template, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      t.template_id,      COUNT(d.document_id) AS num_documents FROM      templates t LEFT JOIN      documents d ON t.template_id = d.template_id GROUP BY      t.template_id; ```  ---  ### Explanation: - **`templates t`**: This table contains the template details, including `template_id`. - **`documents d`**: This table contains references to templates via `template_id`, and includes the `document_id`. - **`LEFT JOIN`**: Ensures that templates without any associated documents still appear in the result (with a count of 0). - **`GROUP BY t.template_id`**: Groups the results by template ID to aggregate the count of documents. - **`COUNT(d.document_id)`

To retrieve **all distinct template IDs** used in documents along with the **number of times each was used**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      DISTINCT template_id,      COUNT(*) AS usage_count FROM      documents GROUP BY      template

To determine the `id` and `type code` of the template used by the **most documents**, we can follow these steps:  1. **Join** the `templates` and `documents` tables on `template_id` to get all documents associated with each template. 2. **Group** the results by `template_id` to count how many documents each template is associated with. 3. **Order** the results by the count of documents in descending order. 4. **Limit** the result to the top entry (i.e., the template with the highest number of documents).  Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:  ```sql SELECT      t.template_id,      t.template_type_code FROM      templates t JOIN      documents d ON t.template_id = d.template_id GROUP BY      t.template_id, t.template_type_code ORDER BY      COUNT(d.document_id) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - `JOIN documents ON t.template_id = d.template_id`: Links each template to its associated documents. - `GROUP BY t.template_id, t.template_type_code`: Groups rows by template ID and

To determine the `template_id` and `template_type_code` of the template used for the **greatest number of documents**, we can follow these steps:  1. **Join** the `templates` and `documents` tables on `template_id` to associate documents with their respective templates. 2. **Group** the results by `template_id` and count the number of documents per template. 3. **Order** the results in descending order based on the count of documents. 4. **Limit** the result to the top record (i.e., the template with the highest count).  Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:  ```sql SELECT      t.template_id,      t.template_type_code,      COUNT(d.document_id) AS doc_count FROM      templates t JOIN      documents d ON t.template_id = d.template_id

To retrieve the `template_id` values of all templates that are used by **more than one document**, we can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT template_id FROM documents GROUP BY template_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`GROUP BY template_id`**: Groups all documents by their `template_id`. - **`HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`**: Filters groups where the number of documents associated with a template exceeds 1.  This query returns the `template_id`s of templates that are referenced in more than one document.

To retrieve the `template_id`s of templates that are used in **more than one document**, we can follow these steps:  1. **Group the documents** by `template_id` to count how many times each template is referenced. 2. **Filter** the results to include only those templates with a count greater than 1.  Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT t.template_id FROM documents d JOIN templates t ON d.template_id = t.template_id GROUP BY t.template_id HAVING COUNT(d.document_id) > 1; ```  ### Explanation: - `JOIN templates t ON d.template_id = t.template_id`: Links each document to its corresponding template. - `GROUP BY t.template_id`: Groups rows by the `template_id`. - `HAVING COUNT(d.document_id) > 1`: Filters groups where the template appears in more than one document.  This query returns all `template_id`s that are associated with at least two documents.

To retrieve the `template_id` values of all templates that are **not used by any document**, we can use a **LEFT JOIN** between the `templates` and `documents` tables on `template_id`. This allows us to identify templates that do not appear in the `documents` table.  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT t.template_id FROM templates t LEFT JOIN documents d ON t.template_id = d.template_id WHERE d.template_id IS NULL; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - **LEFT JOIN**: Links every template to its associated documents. - **WHERE d.template_id IS NULL**: Filters out templates that are referenced in any document. - **t.template_id**: Retrieves the unique identifier of the template.  This query ensures that only templates not used in any document are returned.

To retrieve the `template_id` values from the `templates` table that are **not used in any documents**, we can perform a **left join** between `templates` and `documents` on `template_id`. Any `template_id` that does not appear in the `documents` table will be excluded from the result due to the `IS NULL` condition.  ---  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT t.template_id FROM templates t LEFT JOIN documents d ON t.template_id = d.template_id WHERE d.template_id IS NULL; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - **Left Join**: Ensures all `templates` are included, even if they don‚Äôt have a corresponding `document`. - **Filter with `IS NULL`**: Only includes `template_id`s that are not referenced in the `documents` table. - **Result**: Returns the list of `template_id`s that are **unused** in any document.  This query effectively identifies the templates that are not linked to any document records.

To determine the total number of templates in the database, you can execute the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_templates FROM templates; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `templates` table. - The result will be the total number of templates, including any rows with `NULL` values in columns that are not specified as `NOT NULL`.  This query assumes no additional filtering or constraints are applied, and it directly returns the count of records in the `templates` table.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM templates;

SELECT template_id, version_number, template_type_code   FROM templates;

To retrieve the `id`, `version number`, and `type code` for each template, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      template_id,      version_number,      template_type_code  FROM      templates; ```  ### Explanation: - **`template_id`**: Unique identifier for each template. - **`version_number`**: Version of the template (e.g., 1.0, 2.1). - **`template_type_code`**: Code referencing the template type (e.g., "PDF", "DOCX").  This query directly retrieves the required data from the `templates` table without needing joins or additional filtering.

To retrieve all **distinct** `template_type_code` values from the `templates` table, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT template_type_code FROM templates; ```  ### Explanation: - This query selects the `template_type_code` column from the `templates` table. - The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique values are returned. - Since `template_type_code` is a foreign key referencing the `ref_template_types` table, all values will be valid and exist in the reference table.

To retrieve the different **template type codes** from the database, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT template_type_code  FROM ref_template_types; ```  ### Explanation: - This query selects the `template_type_code` column from the `ref_template_types` table. - Since `template_type_code` is the primary key, each value is unique, ensuring no duplicates. - The result will return all distinct template type codes stored in the database.

To retrieve the `template_id` values of templates with a `template_type_code` of either `"PP"` or `"PPT"`, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT template_id FROM templates WHERE template_type_code IN ('PP', 'PPT'); ```  ### Explanation: - **`SELECT template_id`**: Retrieves the unique identifier for each template. - **`FROM templates`**: Specifies the table containing the template information. - **`WHERE template_type_code IN ('PP', 'PPT')`**: Filters records where the `template_type_code` matches either `"PP"` or `"PPT"`.  This query assumes that the `template_type_code` values in the `templates` table exactly match the specified strings (`PP` and `PPT`).

To retrieve the `template_id` values of templates that have the `template_type_code` of either `"PP"` or `"PPT"`, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT template_id FROM templates WHERE template_type_code IN ('PP', 'PPT'); ```  ### Explanation: - **`templates.template_id`**: This is the column we want to return ‚Äî the unique identifier for each template. - **`template_type_code IN ('PP', 'PPT')`**: This filters the results to only include templates where the `template_type_code` matches either `"PP"` or `"PPT"`.  This query assumes that the `template_type_code` values `"PP"` and `"PPT"` exist in the `ref_template_types` table (as they are valid keys in that table). If such values do not exist, the result will be empty.

To determine how many templates have a `template_type_code` of `'CV'`, we can query the `templates` table directly using a `WHERE` clause to filter by the specified code.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS template_count FROM templates WHERE template_type_code = 'CV'; ```  ### Explanation: - **`COUNT(*):** Counts the number of rows that match the condition. - **`WHERE template_type_code = 'CV':** Filters the results to only include templates with the exact `template_type_code` value `'CV'`.  This query assumes that `'CV'` is a valid `template_type_code` in the `ref_template_types` table (which is enforced by the foreign key relationship). If `'CV'` does not exist in the referenced table, the result will be `0`.

To count the number of templates of type **"CV"**, we need to query the `templates` table and filter records where the `template_type_code` matches `'CV'`. This assumes that `'CV'` is a valid code in the `ref_template_types` table, as specified in the schema.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS template_count FROM templates WHERE template_type_code = 'CV'; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*):` Counts the number of matching rows. - `WHERE template_type_code = 'CV':` Filters records where the template type is "CV". - The result will return the total number of templates with the type `"CV"`.  This query directly addresses the requirement without needing joins or additional lookups, assuming `'CV'` is a valid entry in the `ref_template_types` table.

To retrieve the **version number** and **template type code** for templates with a **version number later than 5**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      version_number,      template_type_code FROM      templates WHERE      version_number > 5; ```  ### Explanation: - `SELECT version_number, template_type_code`: Retrieves the required fields. - `FROM templates`: Specifies the table to query. - `WHERE version_number > 5`: Filters results to include only rows where the version number is greater than 5.  This query will return all matching rows, including their respective `version_number` and `template_type_code`.

SELECT version_number, template_type_code   FROM templates   WHERE version_number > 5;

To retrieve all **template type codes** along with the **number of templates** associated with each, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      template_type_code,      COUNT(*) AS num_templates FROM      templates GROUP BY      template_type_code; ```  ### Explanation: - `templates.template_type_code` references the `template_type_code` column in the `ref_template_types` table. - The `COUNT(*)` function calculates the number of rows (templates) for each unique `template_type_code`. - The `GROUP BY` clause ensures the result is grouped by each distinct template type code.  This query will return a list of template type codes and the count of how many templates exist for each.

To retrieve the distinct **template type codes** along with the number of **templates** associated with each, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      template_type_code,      COUNT(*) AS num_templates FROM      templates GROUP BY      template_type_code; ```  ### Explanation: - `template_type_code`: This column references the `ref_template_types` table, which stores the descriptions of template types. - `COUNT(*)`: Counts the number of rows (templates) for each unique `template_type_code`. - `GROUP BY template_type_code`: Groups the results by each unique template type code to aggregate the counts.  This query will return a result set with two columns: `template_type_code` and `num_templates`, showing each template type and how many templates exist with that type.

To determine which **template type code** has the **highest number of associated templates**, we can analyze the `templates` table by counting occurrences of each `template_type_code`. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this:  ```sql SELECT template_type_code, COUNT(*) AS template_count FROM templates GROUP BY template_type_code ORDER BY template_count DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`GROUP BY template_type_code`**: Groups all records by the `template_type_code` column. - **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the number of templates for each type. - **`ORDER BY template_count DESC`**: Sorts results from most to least frequent. - **`LIMIT 1`**: Returns only the template type code with the highest count.  This query will return the **template type code** that appears most frequently in the `templates` table.

To determine the **type code** of the template type that is used by the **most templates**, we can analyze the `templates` table by grouping records by `template_type_code`, counting the number of templates for each type, and selecting the type with the highest count.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Key Steps: 1. **Group by `template_type_code`**: To count how many templates are associated with each type. 2. **Count occurrences**: Use `COUNT(*)` to tally the number of templates per type. 3. **Order by

This ensures that documents without any paragraphs are included in the results, with a count of `0` for such cases.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      d.document_id,     d.document_name,     COUNT(p.paragraph_id) AS paragraph_count FROM      documents d LEFT JOIN      paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY      d

To retrieve the **IDs and names of each document** along with the **number of paragraphs in each**, we need to perform the following steps:  1. **Join** the `documents` table with the `paragraphs` table on `document_id` to associate each document with its paragraphs. 2. **Group** the results by `document_id` to aggregate the count of paragraphs per document. 3. **

To retrieve all `document_id`s that contain **at least two paragraphs**, we need to:  1. Join the `documents` table with the `paragraphs` table on `document_id`. 2. Group the results by `document_id`. 3. Count the number of paragraphs per document. 4. Filter to include only documents with a count of **two or more** paragraphs.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query: ```sql SELECT d.document_id FROM documents d JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY d.document_id HAVING COUNT(p.paragraph_id) >= 2; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - `JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id`: Ensures we only consider documents that have one or more paragraphs. - `GROUP BY d.document_id`: Groups rows by document ID. - `COUNT(p.paragraph_id) >= 2`: Filters documents with two or more paragraphs.  This query will return the `document_id`s of all documents that have at least two paragraphs.

To retrieve the `document_id` values of documents that contain **two or more paragraphs**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT d.document_id FROM documents d JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY d.document_id HAVING COUNT(p.paragraph_id) >= 2; ```  ---  ### Explanation: - **`JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id`**: Links each document to its associated paragraphs. - **`GROUP BY d.document_id`**: Groups rows by document ID to aggregate data. - **`HAVING COUNT(p.paragraph_id) >= 2`**: Filters groups to include only those documents with **2 or more paragraphs**.  This query returns the unique `document_id`s of documents that meet the condition.

To retrieve the `document_id` and `document_name` of the document(s) with the greatest number of paragraphs, we can follow these steps:  1. **Join** the `documents` table with the `paragraphs` table using the `document_id` column. 2. **Group** the results by `document_id` and count the number of paragraphs for each document. 3. **Order** the results in descending order based on the number of paragraphs. 4. **Limit** the result to the top document(s).  Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      d.document_id,      d.document_name,      COUNT(p.paragraph_id) AS num_paragraphs FROM      documents d JOIN      paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY      d.document_id, d.document_name ORDER BY      num_paragraphs DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - `JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id`: Links each document to its paragraphs. - `GROUP BY d.document_id, d.document_name`: Groups rows by document to count paragraphs per document. - `COUNT(p.paragraph_id) AS num_paragraphs`: Counts the number of paragraphs for each document. - `ORDER BY num_paragraphs DESC`: Sorts the results from most paragraphs to least. - `LIMIT 1`: Returns only the document(s) with the highest number of paragraphs (assuming a unique maximum). If multiple documents share the same maximum, this will return only one (the first in the sorted list).

To retrieve the `id` and `name` of the document with the **most paragraphs**, we can follow these steps:  1. **Join** the `documents` table with the `paragraphs` table on `document_id`. 2. **Group** the results by `document_id` to count the number of paragraphs per document. 3. **Order** the results in descending order based on the count of paragraphs. 4. **Limit** the result to the top document (i.e., the one with the highest count).  Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      d.document_id,      d.document_name FROM      documents d JOIN      paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY      d.document_id ORDER BY

To retrieve the `document_id` of the document with the **fewest paragraphs**, we can follow these steps:  1. **Count the number of paragraphs** for each `document_id`. 2. **Group the results** by `document_id`. 3. **Sort the results** in ascending order based on the count of paragraphs. 4. **Select the first result** (i.e., the document with the fewest paragraphs).  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query:  ```sql SELECT document_id FROM paragraphs GROUP BY document_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT

To retrieve the `document_id` values that contain **1 to 2 paragraphs**, we can perform a **join** between the `documents` and `paragraphs` tables on `document_id`, then **group** the results by `document_id` and apply a **HAVING** clause to filter records with a count of paragraphs between 1 and 2.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query: ```sql SELECT d.document_id FROM documents d JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id GROUP BY d.document_id HAVING COUNT(p.paragraph_id) BETWEEN 1 AND 2; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - **`JOIN paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id`**: Links documents to their associated paragraphs. - **`GROUP BY d.document_id`**: Groups all rows by `document_id`. - **`HAVING COUNT(p.paragraph_id) BETWEEN 1 AND 2`**: Filters groups to only include documents with **1 or 2 paragraphs**.  This query will return the `document_id`s that meet the criteria.

To retrieve the `document_id` values of documents that contain **between one and two paragraphs**, we can use a combination of joins and aggregation. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:  ---  ### üîç Step 1: Join Documents with Paragraphs We need to link the `documents` table with the `paragraphs` table through `document_id`. This allows us to count the number of paragraphs per document.  ---  ### üîß Step 2: Group and Count Paragraphs Group the results by `document_id`, and count the number of paragraphs (`paragraph_id`) for each document.  ---  ### üîÑ Step

To retrieve the `document_id` along with the `paragraph_text` values that match `'Brazil'` or `'Ireland'`, we need to join the `documents` and `paragraphs` tables on `document_id`. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      d.document_id,      p.paragraph_text FROM      documents d JOIN      paragraphs p ON d.document_id = p.document_id WHERE      p.paragraph_text IN ('Brazil', 'Ireland'); ```  ### Explanation: - **`documents.d`** and **`paragraphs.p`** are joined on `document_id`. - The `WHERE` clause filters rows where `paragraph_text` equals either `'Brazil'` or `'Ireland'`. - This returns all `document_id`s that have at least one paragraph with the specified text.

To find the museum with the most staff members, we can query the `museum` table and select the row(s) with the highest value in the `num_of_staff` column. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT museum_id, name FROM museum ORDER BY num_of_staff DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`ORDER BY num_of_staff DESC`**: Sorts the museums in descending order based on the number of staff members. - **`LIMIT 1`**: Ensures only the museum with the highest number of staff members is returned (assuming there is a unique maximum).  If multiple museums have the same maximum number of staff members, this query will return only one (the first one in the sorted list). If you want to include all tied museums, you could use `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()` instead.

To find the **average number of staff** working for museums that were opened **before 2009**, we can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT AVG(num_of_staff) AS average_staff_count FROM museum WHERE open_year < 2009; ```  ### Explanation: - `AVG(num_of_staff)` calculates the average number of staff across all museums meeting the condition. - `open_year < 2009` filters only those museums opened before the year 2009. - The result returns a single value: the average number of staff for such museums.  This query assumes that the `num_of_staff` column contains valid integers representing the number of staff per museum.

To retrieve the **opening year** and **number of staff** for the museum named **"Plaza Museum"**, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT open_year, num_of_staff FROM museum WHERE name = 'Plaza Museum'; ```  ### Explanation: - `museum` is the table containing the required data. - `open_year` and `num_of_staff` are the columns to retrieve. - The `WHERE` clause filters the result to only include rows where the `name` is exactly `'Plaza Museum'`.  This query assumes the museum name is unique and does not require joining with other tables.

To find the names of museums that have **more staff than the minimum staff number** of all museums opened **after 2010**, we follow these steps:  ---  ### üîç Step-by-Step Breakdown:  1. **Filter museums opened after 2010**:      Use `open_year > 2010` to identify relevant museums.  2. **Find the minimum staff count among these museums**:      Use a subquery to calculate the minimum `num_of_staff` for museums opened after 2010.  3. **Select museums with staff count greater than this minimum**:      Compare each museum‚Äôs `num_of_staff` against the calculated minimum.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query:  ```sql SELECT name FROM museum WHERE num_of_staff > (     SELECT MIN(num_of_staff)     FROM museum     WHERE open_year > 2010 ); ```  ---  ### üìå Explanation:  - **Subquery (`SELECT MIN(...)`)**: Computes the minimum `num_of_staff` for museums opened after 2010. - **Outer query**: Filters museums where `num_of_staff` exceeds this minimum value.  This query ensures that only museums with **higher staff numbers** than the lowest-staffed museum opened after 201

To retrieve the `id`, `name`, and `age` of visitors who have visited **some museums more than once**, we need to identify visitors who appear in the `visit` table multiple times. This involves:  1. **Joining** the `visitor` and `visit` tables on `visitor.id = visit.visitor_id`. 2. **Grouping** the results by `visitor.id` to count the number of visits per visitor. 3. Using the `HAVING` clause to filter out visitors who have visited **more than once**.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query:  ```sql SELECT      v.id,      v.name,      v.age FROM      visitor v JOIN      visit w ON v.id

To determine how many museums were opened **after 2013** or **before 2008**, we filter the `museum` table using a `WHERE` clause that checks for the specified conditions:  - `open_year > 2013` (opened after 2013) - `open_year < 2008` (opened before 2008)  We then count the number of rows that meet these criteria using `COUNT(*)`.  ---  ### ‚úÖ Final SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM museum  WHERE open_year > 2013 OR open_year < 2008; ```  This query returns the number of museums that were opened in the specified time frames.

To find the total number of players in the database, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_players FROM players; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `players` table. - Since `player_id` is the primary key, each row represents a unique player. - The result returns the total number of distinct players.  This query directly retrieves the required information without needing joins or subqueries.

To determine the total number of players in the database, we can query the `players` table using the `COUNT()` function on the `player_id` column, as it serves as the primary key and ensures uniqueness.  **SQL Query:** ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_players FROM players; ```  **Explanation:**   - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `players` table.   - Since `player_id` is the primary key, each row represents a unique player, so the result directly gives the total number of players.

To find the total number of matches in the database, you can use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM matches; ```  ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `matches` table. - The result will be the total number of distinct matches, as each row represents a unique match (identified by `match_num` and `tourney_id`).   This query assumes there are no duplicate rows in the `matches` table, which is consistent with the schema definition where `match_num` and `tourney_id` are part of the primary key.

This query will return a result set where each row represents a unique grade and the number of students enrolled in that grade.

To determine which grade has the most high schoolers, we can analyze the `highschooler` table by counting the number of students in each grade and identifying the grade with the highest count.  ### SQL Query: ```sql SELECT grade FROM highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ### Explanation: - **`GROUP BY grade`**: Groups all records by their grade. - **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the number of students in each group (i.e., per grade). - **`ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC`**: Sorts the grades in descending order based on the number of students. - **`LIMIT 1`**: Returns only the grade with the highest count

To determine the grade with the greatest number of high schoolers, we can use an SQL query that groups the `highschooler` table by grade, counts the number of students in each grade, and then selects the grade with the highest count.  ---  ### ‚úÖ **SQL Query**  ```sql SELECT grade FROM highschooler GROUP BY grade ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation  - **`GROUP BY grade`**: Groups all records by the value in the `grade` column. - **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the number of students in each grade. - **`ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC`**: Sorts the results in descending order based on the count of students. - **`LIMIT 1`**: Returns only the grade with the highest count (i.e., the grade with the most students).  This query efficiently identifies the grade that has the largest number of high schoolers in the database.

To retrieve all grades that have **at least 4 students**, we can use the `highschooler` table, which contains the grades and their respective student counts. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT grade FROM highschooler GROUP BY grade HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4; ```  ### Explanation: - **`GROUP BY grade`**: Groups the results by the `grade` column. - **`COUNT(*) >= 4`**: Filters groups where the number of students (counted via `COUNT(*)`) is 4 or more. - This will return only the grades (e.g., `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`) that meet the criteria of having at least 4 students.

To determine which grades have **4 or more high schoolers**, we can use a SQL query that groups the `highschooler` table by grade and filters for groups with a count of 4 or more records.  ### ‚úÖ Key Steps: 1. **Group by Grade**: Group the data by the `grade` column. 2. **Count Records**: Count how many students are in each grade. 3. **Filter Results**: Select only those grades where the count is **‚â• 4**.  ---  ### üìå Final SQL Query:  ```sql SELECT grade FROM highschooler GROUP BY grade HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4; ```  ---  ### üîç Explanation: - `GROUP BY grade`: Groups all students by their grade level. - `COUNT(*) >= 4`: Filters groups where there are 4 or more students. - The result returns the **grades** (e.g., `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`) that meet this condition.  This query assumes no additional constraints beyond the `highschooler` table structure.

To retrieve the **student IDs** along with the **number of friends** each student has, we need to:  1. Join the `highschooler` table with the `friend` table on `student_id`. 2. Count the number of distinct `friend_id` values for each `student_id` using `COUNT(DISTINCT friend_id)` to avoid overcounting friendships (e.g., if a student has two friends, they will appear twice in the `friend` table). 3. Group the results by `student_id`.  Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      h.id AS student_id,      COUNT(DISTINCT f.friend_id) AS num_friends FROM      highschooler h JOIN      friend f ON h.id = f.student_id GROUP BY      h.id; ```  ### Explanation: - `h.id`: Retrieves the student ID from the `highschooler` table. - `f.friend_id`: Represents the friend ID from the `friend` table. - `COUNT(DISTINCT f.friend_id)`: Counts the unique friends for each student. - `GROUP BY

To determine how many friends each student has, we need to count the number of **distinct** `friend_id` entries associated with each `student_id` in the `friend` table. This ensures we account for all unique friendships, even if a student is friends with multiple people.  ---  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT      student_id,      COUNT(DISTINCT friend_id) AS num_friends FROM      friend GROUP BY      student_id; ```  ---  ### üìå Explanation: - **`COUNT(DISTINCT friend_id)`**: Counts the number of unique friends per student. - **`GROUP BY student

Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT      s.name,      SUM(song.sales) AS total_sales FROM      singer s JOIN      song ON s.singer_id = song.singer_id GROUP BY      s.name; ```  ### Explanation: - `s.name`: Retrieves the singer's name. - `SUM(song.sales)`: Calculates the total sales across all songs linked to the singer. - `GROUP BY s.name`: Ensures the result is grouped by each singer's name.  This query returns a list of singers along with the total sales of all their songs.

To retrieve the names of singers who do not have any songs, we can use a **LEFT JOIN** between the `singer` and `song` tables on the `singer_id`. This allows us to identify singers whose `singer_id` does not appear in the `song` table, indicating they have no associated songs.  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT s.name FROM singer s LEFT JOIN song sg ON s.singer_id = sg.singer_id WHERE sg.singer_id IS NULL; ```  ---  ### üìå Explanation: - **`LEFT JOIN`**: Ensures all singers are included in the result, even if they don‚Äôt have any songs. - **`WHERE sg.singer_id IS NULL`**: Filters out singers who have at least one song (i.e., `sg.singer_id` is not `NULL`). - **`s.name`**: Retrieves the name of the singer.  This query efficiently returns the names of singers with no associated songs in the `song` table.

To retrieve the names of every singer who does not have any songs, we need to identify singers whose `singer_id` values are **not** present in the `song` table. This can be achieved by comparing the `singer_id` column of the `singer` table against the `singer_id` column of the `song` table.  ### ‚úÖ Correct SQL Query: ```sql SELECT name  FROM singer  WHERE singer_id NOT IN (SELECT singer_id FROM song); ```  ---  ### üß† Explanation: - **`NOT IN

To determine the total number of **available features** in the database, we need to count the number of rows in the `other_available_features` table. This table contains all features with their associated details, and each row represents a unique feature.  ### ‚úÖ SQL Query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_available_features FROM other_available_features; ```  ### üîç Explanation: - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in the `other_available_features` table. - Each row corresponds to one unique feature (since `feature_id` is the primary key).  This query will return the total number of distinct available features in the database.
